Vim plugin and command line tool for running JSLint (http://jslint.com/).

JSLint is a handy tool that spots errors and common mistakes in JavaScript code.

The source code for jslint.vim is hosted at (http://github.com/hallettj/jslint.vim).

This is alpha software and is under heavy development.


 Usage
 -----------------------

- This plugin automatically checks the JavaScript source and highlights the
  lines with errors.

  It also will display more information about the error in the commandline if the curser is
  in the same line.

- You also can call it manually via `:JSLintUpdate`

- (optional) Add any valid JSLint options to `~/.jslintrc` file, they will be
  used as global options for all JavaScript files.
  For example:

        /*jslint browser: true, regexp: true */
        /*global jQuery, $ */

        /* vim: set ft=javascript: */

To get a detailed report of any issues in your JavaScript file outside of Vim,
run the `bin/jslint` executable in a terminal. For example:

    $ bin/jslint ftplugin/jslint/fulljslint.js

You can copy `bin/jslint` into for `PATH` for easier access. The executable
requires that the Vim plugin is installed and also requires Ruby.

To disable error highlighting altogether add this line to your `~/.vimrc` file:

    let g:JSLintHighlightErrorLine = 0


Alternative Plugins
---------------------

There are other plugins for Vim that integrate JavaScript Lint (http://www.javascriptlint.com/).  JavaScript Lint is another JavaScript checker that is similar to JSLint.

jsl.vim (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2630) uses Vim's compiler infrastructure making its use consistent with syntax checkers for other languages.

javaScriptLint.vim (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2578) runs the contents of a JavaScript file through JavaScript Lint after the file's buffer is saved and places any warnings in the quickfix error window.
